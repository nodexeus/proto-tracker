# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Analyze and backup current schema files
  - Create backup copies of both schema files for safety
  - Document the exact differences between the two files
  - Identify any imports of `schemas 2.py` in the codebase
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Consolidate schema models into single file
  - Use `schemas.py` as the base file (more complete)
  - Add any unique models from `schemas 2.py` that don't exist in main file
  - Ensure all models use consistent `from_attributes = True` configuration
  - Verify forward references are properly handled with quotes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Update any imports referencing the duplicate file
  - Search codebase for imports of `schemas 2.py`
  - Update any found imports to use `schemas.py`
  - Verify no circular import issues are introduced
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Test consolidated schema functionality
  - Import all models from consolidated schema file
  - Run API server to verify no import errors
  - Test model serialization and validation
  - Verify API endpoints still function correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Remove duplicate schema file
  - Delete `api/schemas 2.py` file
  - Verify no remaining references to the deleted file
  - Test full API functionality one final time
  - _Requirements: 1.1_
