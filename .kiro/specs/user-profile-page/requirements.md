# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a user profile page in the proto-tracker frontend application. The profile page will allow users to view their account information and manage their API keys, including viewing existing keys, copying them to clipboard, and creating new API keys for backend authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain infrastructure engineer, I want to access my user profile page so that I can view my account information and manage my API credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on their profile menu THEN the system SHALL navigate to the user profile page
2. WHEN viewing the profile page THEN the system SHALL display the user's name, email, and profile picture from Google OAuth
3. WHEN viewing the profile page THEN the system SHALL show the user's account creation date and last login information
4. WHEN the profile page loads THEN the system SHALL use a clean, responsive layout with Mantine components
5. WHEN accessing the profile page THEN the system SHALL ensure the user is authenticated before displaying any information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the proto-tracker API, I want to view all my existing API keys so that I can see which keys are active and when they were created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the profile page THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated API Keys section
2. WHEN displaying API keys THEN the system SHALL show each key's name, creation date, and last used date
3. WHEN displaying API keys THEN the system SHALL show a truncated version of each key for security (e.g., "pk_live_1234...5678")
4. WHEN no API keys exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message with a call-to-action to create the first key
5. WHEN API keys are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators using Mantine components
6. WHEN API key data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the proto-tracker API, I want to copy my API keys to the clipboard so that I can easily use them in my applications and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an API key THEN the system SHALL provide a copy button next to each key
2. WHEN a user clicks the copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the full API key to the clipboard
3. WHEN an API key is successfully copied THEN the system SHALL show a success notification using Mantine notifications
4. WHEN copying fails THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN hovering over the copy button THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating the copy action
6. WHEN an API key is copied THEN the system SHALL temporarily change the button icon to indicate success

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create new API keys with descriptive names so that I can organize and manage multiple keys for different purposes or environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the API Keys section THEN the system SHALL provide a "Create New API Key" button
2. WHEN creating a new API key THEN the system SHALL display a modal form with a required name field
3. WHEN creating a new API key THEN the system SHALL allow an optional description field for additional context
4. WHEN submitting the form THEN the system SHALL validate that the key name is unique for the user
5. WHEN a new key is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display the full key value once with a warning that it won't be shown again
6. WHEN a new key is created THEN the system SHALL add it to the API keys list and show a success notification
7. WHEN key creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages using Mantine form validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to delete API keys that I no longer need so that I can maintain good security hygiene and reduce the attack surface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an API key THEN the system SHALL provide a delete button for each key
2. WHEN a user clicks delete THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation modal with the key name and creation date
3. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the API key from the system
4. WHEN a key is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and show a success notification
5. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with appropriate messaging
6. WHEN a user has only one API key THEN the system SHALL warn them before deletion that they'll need to create a new key to continue using the API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want the profile page to be responsive and accessible so that I can manage my account from any device with a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the profile page on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout using Mantine's responsive components
2. WHEN using the profile page THEN the system SHALL provide proper keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions for all UI elements
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability of all profile information
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback using Mantine's built-in loading and success states
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display accessible error messages that screen readers can announce

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with the proto-tracker system, I want the profile page to integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication and API infrastructure so that it works reliably with the current system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls for profile data THEN the system SHALL use the existing authentication headers and error handling
2. WHEN API calls fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page or prompt for re-authentication
3. WHEN the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL handle the expiration gracefully and redirect to login
4. WHEN API operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use the existing API service layer and error handling patterns
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully with appropriate messaging
6. WHEN API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL show loading states to keep users informed of the operation status
